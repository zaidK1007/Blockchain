Implementation of Blockchain using Hashes in Python.<br>
PROJECT STRUCTURE<br>
We have implemented Hashing Mechanism in Blockchain
using python. For this project we have created different
modules namely:<br>
• Node.py - This class initiates the application and also
provides the interface for the user.<br>
• Blockchain.py - This Blockchain class manages the structure of the whole chain, the uncommitted transactions and
also the node on which its running.<br>
• Block.py - This class instantiates Blocks to be stored in
the Blockchain<br>
• Transactions.py - This class instantiates the Transactions
of each Block in the Blockchain.<br>
• Verification.py - This class contains various functions to
verify the integrity of the Blockchain, Transactions and
Proof of Work.<br>
• Hash utils.py - This files contains hashing functions that
are frequently accessed.<br>
• blockchain.txt - This file contains data of the blockchain
in json format so that we can load the data back into our
data structures on startup.<br>
• Chain data.txt - This file contains data to be displayed in
proper format.<br>
